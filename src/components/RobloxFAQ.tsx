        question: "What is the Roblox Builder Pathway?",
        answer: "The Roblox Builder Pathway is a 30-day, hardware-backed program at Gamr Lab in Lagos that helps African gamers become Roblox creators. Selected builders get access to high-spec PCs, stable internet, mentorship, and a production-first curriculum to build and publish Afro-centric Roblox experiences."
    },
    {
        question: "Who is this program for?",
        answer: "It’s for serious, Africa-based creators who want to build on Roblox: scripters/programmers, 3D/environment artists, game designers, and technical creatives. You don’t need to be a pro already, but you must have basic skills, a portfolio or samples, and be ready to commit for 30 days of learning."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to pay to join?",
        answer: "No, there is no tuition fee for this pilot cohort. However, selection is competitive and based on your application, portfolio, and availability."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need my own laptop or PC?",
        answer: "No. The program is hardware-backed. Accepted builders will have scheduled access to our gaming-grade workstations at Gamr Lab. If you have your own capable PC, that’s a plus and can supplement your lab time, but it’s not required."
    },
    {
        question: "Where and when does the program take place?",
        answer: "The pilot runs physically at Gamr Lab, Lagos, Nigeria, with a mix of in-person sessions and supported independent work. Cohort 1 exact session days and times will be shared with accepted participants."

    {
        question: "What will I actually learn and build?",

            <>
                You’ll work inside Roblox Studio on real projects, covering:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Luau scripting and core engine concepts</li>
                    <li>World-building, level design, and systems design</li>
                    <li>Monetization (passes, items, events) and basic analytics</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-2">By the end of the program, each participant will have contributed to at least one playable experience with a strong Lagos/African theme.</p>
            </>
        )
    },
    {
        question: "Can I apply if I’m not in Lagos or can’t always come to the Lab?",
        answer: "Yes. As long as you have access to a laptop/PC that can run Roblox Studio and reasonably stable internet, you can apply. Lab rigs are an extra boost for those who need hardware support and will be prioritized for them."
    },
    {
        question: "What are you looking for in applications?",

                We’re looking for:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">

                    <li>A basic portfolio</li>
                    <li>A clear idea of the African/Lagos experience you want to build</li>
                    <li>Realistic availability for the 30-day sprint</li>
